## Overview
Galactic Gainz is a site that aims to introduce newcomers to the world of fitness.  
Getting started with working out can often be intimidating and confusing. Through games and a Tamagotchi-like system, the user is encouraged to learn several exercises to maintain the happiness of their alien companion. This same system also urges users to keep coming back. 

## Gameplay
The user creates an alien creature. This creature comes from a planet where food is scarce, and regular exercise is necessary to evade predators. Because of this, they gain weight easily when sitting still. Now that they've come into your care, it's your responsibility to exercise and feed them to keep them happy and healthy.  
### Exercising
In order to help them to lose weight, the user must do exercises in real life. These simple exercises can be done anywhere with open floor space.    

### Feeding
To feed your alien pal, head out to space and use the WASD or arrow keys to collect food.  

Healthy food appears at the edges of your screen, indicated by a green exclamation mark and outer hue.

Unhealthy food is thrown at you, avoid it at all costs! When hit by these foods, your weight goes up. Thus your speed goes down, ultimately making the game harder. Have no fear though, at any time during the game you can work out to reduce your weight.
